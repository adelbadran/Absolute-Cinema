- **🎭 The Team Mechanic:** Players are split into two teams (A & B) plus one Outsider (C). You don't know your team until you start playing!
- **🧠 Advanced Voting:** You must identify the Outsider AND find your secret teammate.
- **🎁 Round Gifts (Special Roles):** Roles are not permanent! You might get a special "Gift Role" for just one round.

## 🕹️ Game Rules (Detailed)

### 1. Setup
- Needs an **ODD** number of players (5, 7, 9...).
- The game randomly splits players:
    - **Team A:** Gets Word 1.
    - **Team B:** Gets Word 2 (Similar to Word 1).
    - **Outsider (C):** Gets Word 3 (Different).

### 2. The Rounds
- Players take turns giving a **one-word hint** about their secret word.
- **Goal:** Figure out who has the same word as you (Your Team) and who is the Outsider.
- **Twist:** Since words A and B are similar (e.g., "Koshary" vs "Pasta"), it's very hard to distinguish your team from the other team!

### 🎁 Special Roles (Round Gifts)
Every round, random players might get a special role active for **that round only**:
- **🤐 The Mute (الصامت):** Gets SKIPPED. Cannot speak or hint at all this round.
- **🤡 The Joker (المخادع):** Wants to be voted out! If people vote for them, they gain bonus points.
- **🎭 The Actor (الممثل):** Must deliver their hint with a specific emotion/acting style.

### 3. Voting Phase (Crucial!)
Voting happens in two steps:

**Step 1: Who is the Outsider?**
- Vote for the person you think is alone (The Outsider).
- **Strategy:** If you realize *YOU* are the Outsider, you can vote for yourself!

**Step 2: Who is your Teammate?**
- Select one person you trust is on your team (A or B).
- **"No Teammate" Option:** If you think you are the Outsider, you must select **"أنا الدخيل / مليش صاحب"**.

### 4. Scoring
- **Innocent (Team A/B):**
    - **+2** if the Outsider is caught.
    - **+2** if you correctly identify a Teammate.
    - **-2** (Penalty) if you select "No Teammate" incorrectly.
- **Outsider (Team C):**
    - **+5** if you survive (not caught).
    - **+3** (Bonus) if you correctly select "No Teammate" (Self-awareness).
- **Joker Bonus:**
    - **+2** for every vote received against them (if they had the Joker role at any point).
